Project ( Smart Parking Allocation System )
The goal is to create a system that asigm parking spot for cars based on Size, Availability and Arrival order. 

We have decided to code this system in Java, mainly becasue it is an object orianted programing language which is a better option to code our program. 
Secondly, most of the team mambers are comfortable coding in Java.
